 Andrew Joseph Franklin Showers,ashowers@purdue.edu,"b""I would suggest to read the material either from the book or online prior to coming to class, it helps to already have an idea of what you're going to be doing. While you're reading, run through the examples in the book in IDLE to see how they work, instead of wondering what will happen if you do something, do it! And as with any class, be sure to ask questions when you don't know something.""",[b'I agree with your point about just doing the assignment.

 Kavya S Sankhavaram,ksankhav@purdue.edu,"b'The advice that I would give a student starting a class like CS 177 would be to think of learning Python as learning a new language. In the same way that you would have to learn sentence structure and vocabulary for a new language, you have to think of different syntax patterns and prompts in Python. I believe that thinking of Python this way can help it be less daunting, as well as put the student in the correct mindset. The best way I have found to learn the correct syntax is to first study the textbook, and then try trial and error with the IDLE editor, almost like you\xe2\x80\x99re having a conversation with the computer. In this way, the assignments have become less difficult. I have found the problem solving aspect of making an efficient and correct protocol to be the most interesting part of this class.\xc2\xa0'","[b""I think you make a really good point about being patient with yourself. I think that using Python is a bit similar to statistics in that it builds off of the math and language you know, but its a different mindset and way of looking at problems. Its important to keep in mind that you're starting from nothing and building up from there, and being patient is a big part of this. I also think that patience and thoroughly learning the basic skills of Python programming will definitely be more beneficial in the long run.\xc2\xa0""]"
 Neil  Joseph Gallagher,ngallag@purdue.edu,"b""When someone is about to start a CS course, whether for a requirement, or an intent to study the subject further, it's a good idea to figure out what exactly they're getting themselves into. \xc2\xa0As someone who's not a CS major, I really had no idea what I was getting into by taking this course, and looking back I could have used some prior information about python and coding to stay afloat the first week. \xc2\xa0Fortunately, I found that there are ample resources on campus, especially in Lawson willing to help those like myself who don't understand how coding works. \xc2\xa0I found some great help from mentors in CS, that guide me through what I need to do, and don't just tell we what to type, but rather how to operate the system. \xc2\xa0That being said, I think I only have success this way because I look at assignments five days to a week ahead of time and try to complete on my own the first two days. \xc2\xa0If I can't complete it then, I go off and seek help from those who can appropriately teach me. \xc2\xa0Learning how to appropriately code is quite exciting, being able to perform tasks or projects that I never thought I myself could do is quite rewarding. \xc2\xa0After putting in hours of work and achieving a finished result that's correct is all worth it. \xc2\xa0I also enjoy realizing all the different ways the same result can be found, and finding that my code is a personalization of myself and how i think""","[b""You're right Ben, the course did seem to start us off on the deep end, but the book really did help in keeping me afloat and be able to realize what's going on. \xc2\xa0I've never really thought about dissecting the code in a stepwise way like you described, and I'll have to try that!!""]"
 Stuart Andrew Haake,haakes@purdue.edu,"b'For a new student, thinking about programming is unlike anything they\xe2\x80\x99ve learned about before. The order of arguments is something that can be challenging at first.\xc2\xa0 The best way, for me, to start a program is to get a variable down. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter how that variable is going to be defined; the only thing that matters is getting that foothold.\xc2\xa0 Once you have that participant in play, it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot easier to think about what you need to do with it to achieve the goal of the program: the modules that might be needed, the other variables that are going to interact with the first variable, how that first variable needs to be defined, etc.\xc2\xa0 In other words, I prefer to just dive in to the coding.\xc2\xa0 To me, planning and studying for assignments is futile; there will always be a never-ending list of things that a programmer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 That is a programmer\xe2\x80\x99s biggest strength.\xc2\xa0 It is very easy to code confidently when you know that there is always a way, and solving the ignorance issue is an amazing way to learn.\xc2\xa0 You might embark on what you think is a short programming journey only to end up learning about automated gui, dictionaries, lists, pixel identification, and if statements before the curriculum mandates.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s fun, and if you get on a roll, whatever you do, don\xe2\x80\x99t stop.

It is really difficult to jump right into the coursework based on what we learn in the first few weeks of class and the textbook.\xc2\xa0 I also agree that the internet has taught me way more about programming thus far than the textbook or lectures. New students should really be taught about all of the online coding resources. Great advice for a new student, Jingyu!']"
Abby Leigh Perkins,roota@purdue.edu,"b'Some advice that I would give another student who is about to start a class like CS 177 is to understand that debugging/troubleshooting is very common with programming. I had to learn that it is typical for a program to not work the first time running it. I have learned to use the debugging process as a way to learn about my code. If a program will not run, I learn what errors I made in my code and try to not repeat the same errors in the future. \xc2\xa0A way to decrease the amount of time spend debugging/troubleshooting would be to write out codes before actually typing it in the program. When I started coding in this class, I would want to immediately start typing a code into Python. I learned that it is much more productive to write out my thought process on paper and then structure my code around that writing. By writing out your thought process and what you want the code to do, you are more likely to remember all steps when typing the code out.\xc2\xa0\n'","[b""I agree that learning to code is like learning a new language. That is one of my struggles in this class because I have to learn how to write in 'Python's language'. Also, the programming\xc2\xa0troubleshooting process is new to me. Since I am also a non-CS major, the only troubleshooting I have to do is done in the lab. I am familiar with troubleshooting equipment malfunctions or experimental design. What's new to me is that an error in my code could be because of something so small like a misplaced comma or capitalizing a letter when it should be lowercase. I have to become more familiar with examining every letter/number/symbol in my code when trying to figure out what I did wrong. This problem will become increasingly difficult when our codes become much longer.\xc2\xa0""]"

Alan Wang,wang2773@purdue.edu,"b'My advice I would give to a new student is to purchase and read the textbook. This is a fast paced course, and the student is responsible for covering a lot of the material themselves. The textbook does a good job of explaining why and how we use Python to people with little or no coding experience and it is a very good resource to have when stuck on homework or other assignments.'","[b'Teaching others, for me is the fastest to learn something so I definitely agree with your advice.

Alexandra Gotkowski,agotkows@purdue.edu,"b'Like a good majority of this class, I am not a CS major. To be completely honest, I have never even had the desire to be in a computer science class. It is completely new to me. It reminds me of the good old days of learning a new speaking language. With that being said, I have learned a few tips that I would like to share with a student about to take CS177 for the first time.\n1.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I would tell them to be prepared to experience failure. I am NOT saying that they would fail the class, but there are going to be a lot of times that you will not get a code correct or get your program to work. It is extremely frustrating when you cannot work out a problem, but do not let that stop you. It is exactly like learning anything else that is new\xe2\x80\xa6 it takes practice! I will tell you what, there was a great sense of accomplishment when I finally get a program to work! So, in other words, have a lot of patience in this class! Things will start to make sense after a while.\n2.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I would also tell people that there is a ton of extra help available in this course. It is amazing how helpful the professor and TAs are. They understand that this course is very different from our others.\n3.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Many students in this class have mentioned that watching online videos can be beneficial and I strongly agree. I am a visual learner. With that being said, I do not learn well from reading the book. I have to actually watch/see how things can be done. Take advantage of online help. It is just another way to try and understand Python better.\n4.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Open up your mind. There are many ways to do things in this class. Python allows you to make one program by taking different approaches. So, it is perfectly fine to create a program differently than your friends! In fact, that is what they strongly advise in CS177.\xc2\xa0\n'","[b""Emily!\xc2\xa0\nThis is very helpful advice. In fact, it was advice that I recently tried since I do not follow the book very well. I am a visual learner and would much rather watch how people work through programming problems than read about them. To be 100% honest, there's been many times when I have no idea what I am doing! The professor and TAs were not available during a lot of those times and so I tried looking to the internet for help. Being able to see how others faced programming problems opened up my eyes to different approaches that I could take as well. It is just another way of trying to understand Python outside of class. I am not saying that the book is a bad source, because it has helped me with many assignment problems. It is just a bit harder for me to comprehend. For some people it takes many different explanations of a topic for them to be able to understand it. Youtube videos can serve as some of those extra explanations.\xc2\xa0""]"
Alexandra Kinzer,akinzer@purdue.edu,"b'My advice for a new student in CS 177 is to try to understand how and why every new piece of code that you learn works. This will allow you to apply very basic pieces of code, like what you do in codelab, in labs or on exams. For example, I thought that I knew what a for loop was, and how they worked, until I tried to do prelab 1. Without knowing exactly what a single column for loop does, it was very difficult to construct a number grid. Understanding exactly what the code does will also make it easier to apply the codes you have learned to a problem you have not seen before on an exam.'","[b'I do not think that I would advise new students to use google on other online resources for assignment help, at least as their first resource. In my experience, this lead to formatting and functions that we had not learned yet, and ended up confusing me more. While what you find online may allow the program to run, it could end up in misunderstanding what the code is actually doing, and how to apply those principles to a different problem. For example, without knowing why or how a code\xc2\xa0works, you will not be able to manipulate it to use it again in a lab or exam.']"
Allen Michael Hooton,hootona@purdue.edu,"b""The most important things that have helped me so far in CS 177 is reading the book and doing the homework assignments. Reading the material will give you an understanding of what is going on in class/labs and solutions to some common challenges or problems with day to day programming. Doing the homework makes you practice what you've read. Simply reading the book will only take you so far. Practicing what you've learned in the readings will be a good tool when solving the problems in the pre-lab and during the labs.\n\nThe last thing that I would recommend is getting help when you don't understand something. This could be the most important part because everything that we learn is going to be a building block that will be required to know later in the semester. If you don't learn why a certain part of your code works the way it does/don't understand how to get to the answer, get help. Proceeding without completely understanding the assignment will snowball and make things so much tougher in the future.""","[b'""The easiest way to keep on track is to have a grasp of the topic before coming to lecture. You don\'t have to know the ins and outs, just make sure you\'re able to keep on track. Look at the syllabus and see what you should look up beforehand.""\n\nThis is such a good piece of information to give someone. It will help them ""learn how to learn"" and will make the student absorb more information during lectures and recitations.\n\nI think that it COULD hurt the student writing the code for a certain example down in their notes. It is definitely nice to have a reference if they get stuck but if they simply look at their notes and copy the loop down, then I don\'t think this enhances their understanding. In my experience with coding and helping friends with assignments from a previous class, I think it is more beneficial to have an understanding of how to write the code than to have that section of code written out in their notes. I think they will learn more thinking and re-writing the loop than referencing an old piece of code. However, I think it is better to look at an old piece of code than to spend an hour trying to write a function that will compute the average.\n']"
Andros Mikhael C Perez,perez157@purdue.edu,"b'Honestly, I have zero experience in coding. I never had to take any computer classes during high school. I have talked to some people and most of them have some sort of background with coding. The first week was absolutely horrible for me because I did not know where to start with the homework because we did not have lecture. One thing that really helped me was the book. It had all the information that I needed and all I had to do was to interpret them. This is what I have been doing the past weeks. I would read the chapters in the book in advance for when we have lectures or recitations which really helped me keep up with all the codes. I have also started compiling all the commands that I have used so I have a go-to sheet when I was not entirely sure what to do.'","[b'I cannot agree with you more. Patience and persistence is key.

Anthony Senese,senese0@purdue.edu,"b'Something that has challenged me the most in CS 177 has been figuring out how to make a program work.

April Przyborski,aprzybo@purdue.edu,"b'The advice that I would give to a student who is about to take a class like CS 177 would be to not procrastinate on assignments. I believe many students have probably been told the same thing for many courses, but have gotten by still. However, I believe that CS 177 is a course where many are new to programming, and it takes time to figure out. You will not be able to figure it out the hour before an assignment is due, so don\xe2\x80\x99t do that to yourself! Programming can be very frustrating when you are first learning it, but don\xe2\x80\x99t get discouraged if you cannot get the code on the first try. Learning how to debug your code and figure out what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing wrong is a very valuable skill in programming. Be sure to give yourself time to do assignments so that if you get stuck you can reach out to one of the many resources that the class provides for help: piazza, CS help room, TA\xe2\x80\x99s, the professor, the book, etc. I would also advise you to not look up how to do anything on google until you have used every other resource! It is important to think out all of the problems or you will not learn how to code python properly.\xc2\xa0\n'","[b""This is very good advice! One of the most important points is to ask for help if you need it.

Archana Kikla,akikla@purdue.edu,"b""My advice for another beginner student would be to talk through your code and explain it to someone.

Ashley Dicks,dicksa@purdue.edu,"b'The advice I would give to new programmers and those interested in learning a computer language is to ""mess around"" with that program before starting course work.

Austin Lynn Campbell,campb179@purdue.edu,"b""My advice is to write programs throughout the week that involve the topics learned from class that week. The homework is great, but it's guided by giving you what they are looking for. You should create something that gives you want you want. They don't have to be complex or do anything special, but it will really help you to learn how to write out the syntax. You don't want to be struggling through a live coding exam because you've only written one or two for loops total.\n\nAnother idea would be to create a program and then build on it with each new topic. Week one start with defining some variables and using the print statement, week two add a for loop or two in there, etc. I haven't done this myself yet, but I'm going to start one soon.\n\nThe easiest way to keep on track is to have a grasp of the topic before coming to lecture. You don't have to know the ins and outs, just make sure you're able to keep on track. Look at the syllabus and see what you should look up beforehand.\n\nStart very early on homework, pre-labs, and projects. Chances are that it will take you some time to complete these until you fully grasp the concepts.\n\nWhen you learn how to write a program that does a specific task, like solve a factorial equation for example, write out that program in your notebook so that you have it with you next time you encounter something similar.\n\nIn my opinion, the textbook used for this class isn't that great. If you have the resources I would suggest Mark Lutz - Learning Python. His book goes into way further detail but it will also cover a lot of topics that you may or may not need.\n\nAsk questions if you have them.""","[b'And finding the solution online is likely to give you a different way to code it. Like using a while loop instead of a for loop.', b""Adding to this, I'd save everything that you code and completed programs that you've done so that you can refer back to them if you get stuck.

baoheng kuang,kuangb@purdue.edu,"b'My major is chemistry and I really not good at coding. Honestly, the reason that I take this CS 177 is the requirement of my chemistry degree. One of the most challenge thing for me during coding is logic. If I want to programing, I should definitely list how can I get to the result step by step at the beginning. It is really hard for me to think a thing in sequence like calculation, for example, ""for"" loop. I aways thinking about what should be placed in the loop to do a circulation and what should be placed outside the loop to add into the program after the circulation. Although I feel ""for"" loop is hard at first, I can understand how the ""for""loop running.\nThe other challenge thing is debug. Since I am a careless person, I always make stupid mistake and don\'t even know.

Barbara Korcz,bkorcz@purdue.edu,"b'As someone who has never taken a CS class\xc2\xa0before this class is challenge. But one of the biggest pieces of advice I can give would honestly be check your variable names. A lot of times I will get invalid syntax just because I wrote ""Print"" instead of ""print"" or I misspelled one of my variables trying to finish my program quickly. I also think it\'s a really great idea to play with python in your free time and look up easy program examples on programmiz, just to get a basic idea of how to write a program and maybe try to manipulate the program to do something else. For example if the program asks for the sum or two numbers change it so it shows the difference of two numbers, even something as simple as this will get you more familiar with working with python.\xc2\xa0'","[b'I really could not agree more. Our textbook is very easy to read, cheap and has a lot of examples present.

Ben Gaffney,bgaffney@purdue.edu,"b""My advice to a new CS 177 student:\n\nDo not be afraid to branch out and get to know people. Group effort is a major part of CS 177 and if all of the team members are contributing equally then the assignments and projects will be much smoother. Also, go to the help rooms if needed. There will be times when the code might not make sense to you or you can't figure out a homework/pre-lab and the help rooms will really explain it well and it has helped me. Since the first one to two homework's can be a little confusing, because you are still getting used to the Python program and might not know exactly what you are trying to do, the help room will get you back on the right track.""","[b""I agree with this. There have been several times in the first few homework's/pre-labs where I had no idea where to start or had half of it done and did not know where to go from there. Looking in the book can really help clear up some of your questions and problems with your code. Logic is also a very key thing to use.

Sometimes just step back and look at your code and there will be a simple equation or statement that is formatted wrong and it will fix the code.""]"
Ben Haberly,bhaberly@purdue.edu,"b'The most challenging part of CS 177 has been knowing where we are in the book in relation to what we are talking about in class. The first two weeks were a bit hectic because we missed a lab and a lecture due to holidays, so the class didn\'t really feel like it truly started until the third week of school. By then, however, we had already had several assignments due. The best way to study for this class is to read the book and take notes over the important sections. Most of what I have learned about Python so far has come from the book instead of lecture or recitation. Furthermore, make sure you read the book before lecture and recitation so you already have a background on what you are being taught. In the book, focus on the examples of written code. See if you can dissect the code and figure out what each part is there for and what function it serves. To successfully complete the assignments, start them early. If you have questions, you have plenty of time to go to office hours or ask questions in piazza.The most fun part of this class so far has been finally understanding what everyone means when they talk about ""coding.""

Bridget Kilbride,bkilbrid@purdue.edu,"b""For the new student in CS 177, I would advise to adjust the way one thinks.

A few easy steps for me have helped me solve problems on my own, without the aid of Google.\n\n1) Know what your output is first. Then, know what inputs your code is taking in (if necessary).\n2) Be aware of the functions that you know. What do you need to do to manipulate your inputs such that they produce your desired outputs?\n3) Don't be afraid of trial and error! Trying your code will not hurt you in any way.

Caleb Nash,nash19@purdue.edu,"b""Personally I believe the most difficult thing about programming in general would be the debugging process. Debugging can be a very frustrating and time consuming task. You can follow the early steps to the development process very precisely and still have bugs. It also doesn't help that there are many different types of errors that you need to understand to fix the bugs. It can be even more irritating if you don't get any errors. Sometimes the program just does't do what you expect with, and then you have to search your code for error and fix it. I think it is important to keep a cool head during the debugging process. Try to take breaks if you run in to a wall, it will help you calm down and maybe give you a new perspective to solve the problem.\n""",[]
Carolina Vogel,vogel11@purdue.edu,"b'My advice to a new student in CS is relatively simple: use your resources.\n\nBy this I mean purchase the textbook- and read it. I suggest doing this prior to attempting any assignment, because as others before me have stated, this is brand new stuff for many of us. The book, this discussion forum, and reading through the assignments thoroughly will enable you to complete your homework or prelab with minimal difficulty. I say reading the assignments thoroughly because I noticed that many people commented this week with prelab questions and did not seem to realize that the instructions made the goal very clear (such as what type/how many for loops to write). In addition, the professor includes some hints (like using the end=""/t"" function to create tabs for this week\'s prelab) that explicitly give you a way to solve the problem the assignment suggests (in the tab example it showed you how to format the rows). Paying attention to details like this will help you immensely!\n\nI\'ve also found it really useful to ""experiment"" in Idle. Since CodeLab sometimes requires you to match their syntax exactly, messing around in Idle and seeing if my code would be successful has enabled me to solve some trickier homework questions that I struggled with initially.'","[b'Hi Erika,\xc2\xa0\nI really think your first point has been my biggest challenge this semester!

It has been helpful for me to practice patience and sometimes step away from the assignment and come back later and try again.

Carson Ward,ward98@purdue.edu,"b'So far in cs 177, the most challenging thing for me has been the formatting of code. It is not the theory or logic behind it, but simply the notation of how to get an idea or process to work out. The best way for me to prepare for assignments and labs is to do the reading in the textbook and then go through the examples provided. Actually typing out the examples and changing small portions of them helps me to understand the idiosyncrasies of the code and look at different ways of accomplishing the same task. The most important thing to focus on is understanding the logic behind the code.

Chirag Patel,patel335@purdue.edu,"b'The first piece of advice, which I have received from my friends who do code, is to make sure that you understand the logic of coding.

This means when the text book gives examples, go through the code slowly to make sure you know what the code is doing and what all the components of the code mean. In addition, another helpful tip is to use your resources. If you are stuck on the homework or another coding assignment, talk to a TA, use your textbook, talk to the professor, look online (ex. Stackoverflow, or ask a friend (do not cheat). Another helpful tip that I have received from friends, is to struggle and try to figure out the homework by yourself. This way you learn how to troubleshoot on your own and you are not dependent on help from others. Finally, make sure that you do not fall behind.

For me, it is rather annoying that if I put a space somewhere in my code and it works fine in IDLE but it is wrong in the homework. Practice writing, formatting, and using functions in IDLE on your computer. This will help you understand the syntax more and you will perform better on the labs and the tests than if you practice in the homework. The homework is not bad, but the errors you get with spacing can be troublesome if you are attempting to learn the language.

Regardless of what language a person speaks the goal is the same- to tell someone else to do something or about something. A coding language is no different except for the fact that you are trying to ""talk"" to a computer instead of a person. When you tell someone to do something you give the instructions in order: you don\'t jump around. So when trying to give the computer instructions; pause and ask ""if I was trying to tell this to someone else, does this order make sense?"".

Dustin Riddle,riddle10@purdue.edu,"b'Beginning to learn programming is not hard as long as you approach it in the right way. First of all I think one of the most helpful methods to create working code is by planning it out before you start. You can do this by putting comments to organize and plan out each part of the code. This is useful because it allows you to go back and see what the function of each line of code. It also allows you to find problems within your code faster and more efficiently. The odds are you are naturally going to make many mistakes when you first start so this becomes very useful. It also ensures that you do not forget any function that the code is suppose to have which comes in handy when you are dealing with projects that require several functions. Lastly, it is very important that you are very comfortable with the information you are learning while you are learning it before you move on to a new topic. Let me explain, learning to code is like building a house. If you don\'t have the fundamentals down or in this comparison, the foundation of the house built well, you will struggle with future topics that you will learn and your ""house"" will fall down. You need a strong foundation to build off up in order to learn and understand the harder topics you will learn in the future. For example if you don\'t know how to create variables you are going to struggle with making for loops.'","[b""I agree with this. Although some of the inputs into your code may work others won't.

My advice while writing the prelab would be to first write the comments and do the sections you know how to do first (ex: prompting the user or defining a variable). Then, you can begin to fill in the harder parts and devote your time to the parts that you are unsure of and might need to ask for help.

Every time a new skill is learned, it is important to try and understand how to implement it in Python and what the outcome of it is. The repetition of solving coding problems in the pre-lab assignment and the lab assignment allows students to first try the code out on their own, and then stabilize the skill in lab with the assistance of the TA's. The coding is easier to practice when it can be applied to a real life, hypothetical, example, which is why the assignments in CS 177 are better coding practice than assignments that would just tell us to do something without explaining why.

For those of us who have just started coding in CS 177, it can still seem a little daunting to have to only work out of the Python program!

Erika Vannarsdall,evannars@purdue.edu,"b""Wading through the simplest of assignments has definitely been a challenge for someone like me who's never taken a CS class before, but I've already learned a few things that I would suggest to another CS newbie.\n1. Be patient with yourself and the learning curve. It's a process of learning a new way of solving problems, so it's going to take some time to get really good at it! Before you know it, you'll be able to do things you had no idea existed only a week beforehand.\n2. Really read into the assignments. Often, there's a key word or part of the prompt that gives a huge clue as to what you're supposed to accomplish. So if there's a comment that seems important, a good place to start is looking into the book or other resources to get familiar with the concept so that you can apply it to how you think about writing your code.\n3.

Evan Wilson,wilso699@purdue.edu,"b'If I were to give advice to a student that is new to CS at this point in the course, I would tell them that they need to use what is covered in the book and in the lecture as building blocks for the assignments, especially the pre-labs and labs. For the homework assignments, those can be completed by paying attention during lecture and recitation, and reading the corresponding materials in the book carefully. For pre-lab assignments, however, I would say that more out-of-the-box thinking is required. By that, I mean that you need to use the skills you have learned so far, and think of a new way you could apply them to the problem you are given. In order to apply the knowledge in this way, you must have a firm understanding of the base concepts, which is why the best advice I can give is to take in everything you can from lecture and homework, and know that you will be using that later.'",[]

It can seem very scary to start coding/programming in college when you have never done it before. It is key to not write it off as an insurmountable challenge, be confident about learning and this will guide you. For me, I had found it difficult to start codes because I have no idea what I am supposed to do because I have never coded before and I started assignments late because I thought it would not be that difficult. To avoid this extra stress, I would suggest giving yourself enough time get help on the assignment should you need. Start the homework early enough that you have time to attend office hours so as to make sure you understand your code. This will help when working on the lab and lab prep. It is important to also have your book handy, the book is very helpful and well explained, this is a very useful tool, and I use it when I am stuck. It is my first point of reference. I would also go to recitations and lecture because the exercises in these classes are useful for preparing you for lab and also for the homework. It gives a basis for understanding, and there are other students present who can also help your understanding. Remember to keep an open mind! Study the textbook, go to class and keep enough time between work to attend office hours if need be!'","[b'I completely agree with your advice especially understanding the logic, it is one thing to complete the code and another thing to actually understand why the code works.

Understanding the logic is something i have been trying to force myself to do in this class so as to make it easier for me to succeed in assignments and in exams with the hope that i will be able to successfully program at the end of this class.

The textbook has numerous examples at the end of each chapter and if you can do all these examples, it will really improve your programming skills and implant the necessary knowledge in your brain that is needed to succeed. Third, ask questions. There are no stupid questions and the more you ask, the more you will learn and understand, thus the better you will do in class.

CS 177 is different than most courses in such a way that the answer is not always flat out given to you through a set method or use of formulas. You must read the book to understand concepts and then use his own knowledge and thinking style to actually produce the code.

Other times, even if my code works, it may not be designed in the most efficient manner (which is very important too!).

Writing an algorithm that outlines the skeleton of my code (what should have to be defined, what should the output look like, what are some tools I may need to make this work).

For instance, prelab and lab 3 required the use of a nested loop. The past week only required one nested loop within the for loop but if it becomes longer, it can be hard to keep track of what each part of the loop is doing and will just result in more time being used in an inefficient manner. Also, I believe that commenting well and having multiple print statements to ensure that the correct answer is being calculated for a more complex code helps with troubleshooting as well as keeping track of the code.

Joseph,buckle10@purdue.edu,"b'To any CS 177 students new to the class, be sure to visit the CS Help room whenever you need help.

Joshua Leverich,jleveric@purdue.edu,"b""My advice to a new CS student: have fun with the class.\n\nI tried learning a couple of programming languages in high school and, not being in any interactive classes, quickly became bored with them. In CS 177 the instruction is more clear and the projects are more understandable. You can see how your code is making your program work. It's a pretty amazing feeling to get a tough project working. Unlike my other classes, I'm very interested in this class. I do not have the same desire to learn English or Math as I do to learn about programming.\n\nAnother piece of advice would be to use the book as your main resource. There are many versions of Python out there and Google'ing a question most likely will not yield the correct results (the program might work but it's not written the way that you're supposed to write it). Ask your TA's questions and get help when you need it. You're learning a very practical application and, especially if you're a CS major, you should do you best to learn and have fun with this class.""","[b""Another thing is to make sure you're asking questions. A lot of this stuff, at least for me, can only be explained through application (lab time is probably where I do most of my learning).

Joy Cook,cook152@purdue.edu,"b""When I first started this course I had absolutely no experience in coding. I didn't even know how to open python. The best advice I could give someone new to coding would be practice, practice, PRACTICE!\n\n1. Take the time to learn the terminology. It helps a lot. Any resources you use to try to familiarize yourself will use the terminology.\n2. Familiarize yourself with Idle. Play around with the new things you learn and see how you can reach the same solution in other ways.\n3. Plan out your steps. Think about how you would complete the task and write it out in words first. Thinking it out without thinking in code helps to get a clear perspective.\n4. Customize and organize your code. By making the code specific to you will help it to be clearer to read and will help you identify your thought process later on.\n5. Include any notes or changes you make along the way. If you write down what you changed it will help you to locate a problem easier and maybe jog your memory as to why you did so.\n6. Double check your work. Python is very particular about colons and parentheses. Before making major changes make sure everything is there.\n\nA great source I found was code academy. I am a visual learner so getting simple and real time practice was a huge benefit. Id also take the time out to really use the text book.""",[b'I agree that practice is key.

Julianne Billerman,jbillerm@purdue.edu,"b""One of the most challenging parts about this class for me is the process of coming up with the code. I tend to start\xc2\xa0writing the code right away instead of thinking about what the problem is and how I am going to solve it. In the last lecture, we discussed the importance of starting with the comments in order to better organize your code and make it easier to understand not only for yourself, but for other people. It is like creating an outline for an English paper. I think starting off with comments is a good approach for beginning your code.\n\nFor studying, I think repetition really helps as well as creating and running different codes in Python and seeing what the output is. Sometimes I like to do the homework and Prelab assignments more than once without looking at the code to make sure\xc2\xa0I really understand it. Especially for the for loops, I had trouble understanding how the computer was reading my code, so I actually wrote out what was happening on a piece of paper.

I am often unsure what commands to use when starting off my code and how to plug in my equations, but once I get past that initial step, then the rest of the code is easy.

Katherine Sherburne,ksherbu@purdue.edu,"b'The best advice I could give to someone who is new to CS is to start early and be very thorough.

It also helps to take breaks when you are stuck\xc2\xa0on an assignment - if you let yourself do something else for a little bit, it will help you get over ""writer\'s block"" and you might come back with a new idea to try. I do the problems in the book (in the chapters assigned) on my computer as I am reading, and those problems are extremely helpful when it comes time to do the homework. A lot of the problems are very similar, so doing the problems along with the reading makes it easier to understand the meaning behind the code you are writing.

If you start working on the prelab or homework in advance, you can skip the problems you are having trouble on and return to them later with a fresh mind.

Kyle Ruger,ruger@purdue.edu,"b""Some thoughts for the beginning programmer...\n\nI) To someone who has no prior programming experience, learning a language can be a large task. The best way to learn a language is to start with the basics. Like math and science, learning a programming language is a structured process. It builds upon itself. Just like one needs to be able to add before they can multiply, a beginning programmer needs to become acquainted with the basics of the language.\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 i) Start with the basics. Become familiar with variable assignments, variable types, and basic arithmetic operations. Be able to perform simple calculations and variable assignments. Knowing how these work are essential to continuing on in learning. These are like the skeleton of your programming abilities.\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ii) Next work on understanding built in operators and functions. Know how to convert variables from one type to another. Know how to take a user input and assign it to a variable. Know how to use for and while loops. These will give you versatility in what you can do with your program. This will be the nervous and muscular systems. It will get data inputted, transferred, stored, and outputted.\nThese are the basics that will be important to mastering any language.\n\nII) Practice makes Permanent! If I have heard it once, I have heard it a million times, Practice makes Permanent! Cheesy but True.\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 i) Habits begin forming as soon as you start to write your very first script. Practice good coding standards. Use comments frequently. If your code changes, change the comment to reflect what changes. The sharp sign / pound sign '#' is the comment symbol for python.\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ii) Keep old code, scripts, assignments, and such. They are great resources to help you when you forget how something works, and can provide templates to solve new problems.\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 iii) Play around on IDLE. Learn how things work, and what will throw an error. This hands on experience will help you get familiar with the nuances of programming in python.\n\nIII) Make It Fun / Make It Useful\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 i) Consider taking what you are learning and apply it to other areas of study. Make a program that can convert units for a physics class, or a program that will do vector addition for a math class. Use it in presentations and projects. There are many applications of programming that can be used to help your life. Some non CS classes you will take will have a programming component. PHYS 172 and 272 use VPython, a subset of python. ENGR 141 and 142 use Python as well. Knowing python will help tremendously with these activities.\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ii) Create a program just for fun. Play around with printing strings. Make an interactive game with a user inputs. Try to solve problems in new ways. Create a universal formula sheet/solver for basic geometric shapes. Create designs using print statements.\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 iii) Consider an app for your phone that is an editor, IDLE, or python instructor. These will allow you to be able to practice programming when you only have a minute or two.\n\nIV) Get help if you need it.\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 i) Your textbook, your Teachers, your TAs are all great resources. If you have questions/issues ask.\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ii) Work on learning why the program works instead of just getting an answer. This will make it easier to reuse. \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 iii) I personally find the python reference library helpful for finding and using both modules and built in operations and functions.\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 iv) Although Stack Exchange and other online help sites may give you an answer, just be cautious you understand why you are doing what they said. There are times they will give an answer that is above your skill level, or introduce concepts that have not been taught in class. If you use such sites, make sure you are learning the code concepts, and not just looking for an answer.\n\n# Closing Comments:\n# Comments are important. Use them often and with purpose\n\n# The only way to learn to write good code is to have experience. The only way to get experience is to write bad code.\n\n# If you are having trouble working through a solution, try diagramming a flow chart. For people who did not pass through ENGR 141 or who are not familiar, a flowchart is a diagram that represents an algorithm or workflow. It involves writing down the ideas of your program with symbols that represent different types of operations.\nThe visual path of information that you want your program to follow can be very helpful. It will allow you to show exactly what you want done, and what the possible\noutcomes should be. The Wikipedia page on flow-charting can help those who are not familiar with the concept.\n\nGood Luck and Happy Programming""","[b'Just some thoughts building off of 2.\nI find that when I take the time to analyze a problem, I not only cut down on time spent writing the code, but the code itself comes out neater and organized. As someone who likes to jump in and start writing before analyzing, I can say that my code is a lot cleaner and more efficient when I take the time to write out a plan. Writing down the flow of your program on paper can be helpful if you are not sure of how to accomplish the assigned task.', b'In addition to what was suggested above, I would also suggest keeping all of your old homework and labs. That way you can look back at previous work. That way, you have some completed structures that you can use to base ideas off of.

Sometimes when I am stuck on a problem, I look for a problem that I have previously solved and use that code as a guide to solving the new problem.']"

My best advice would be to go slow and try not to get frustrated if the code doesn't work on the first try. Even if you are unsure if something will work, try it! If it doesn't work, try making little adjustments. Use as many resources as you have available (especially the textbook!) and try to refrain from Googling how to do things.

Maaz Arif,arif@purdue.edu,"b""As many others have also mentioned, this is the first coding class I have ever taken, and coming from a heavy Biology/Biochemistry background, its definitely exercised a different part of my brain that I was not used to using in my field. And I think all students in this class need to realize this. \xc2\xa0It wasn't until week 3 that I realized I cannot treat this class like a regular biology class. I am used to the professor telling me what we need to know, and then I would go home and learn it. Also, memorizing comes in handy when you need to learn the bodies anatomy or biochemical pathways. You could spend hours memorizing and writing theses until you have it down perfectly - and even if you might not have fully understood WHAT you were learning - you could still do fine on the exam when it asked you to recall. This is a complete 180 in this class. There is no one to to tell me what I need to know...I must figure that out myself. Also, memorizing plays a minor role. Of course, I need to know the basics, but more importantly, I need to COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND what I am doing. If you memorized how to do one problem, it won't help you at all on the exam where the questions ask for something completely different, yet still requires you to know the fundamentals. Finally, another aspect of CS that differs from Biology is the role of assistance. If you're stuck on a problem, don't immediately seek out help. Spend time dwelling on the problem, accessing the book, and trying it a few times. Only after exhausting all your means should you ask for help.\xc2\xa0\n\nTo be successful, I think you should focus on understanding every aspect of the code.

Do you understand the concept of\xc2\xa0tabbing, how a line incorrectly tabbed can result in a non-functional code?

Mallory Cescato,mcescato@purdue.edu,"b'The aspect of CS 177 that I have struggled with the most is trying to not feel overwhelmed when approaching a problem.

My advice to other students would be to take a few minutes to slowly read the problem, and approach it in pieces. I have found that separating the assignment into different parts is much easier than trying to tackle the entire thing at once. Additionally, it is important to not feel discouraged when a code does not work out, because there is usually a simple fix that can be applied in order for it to work. There have been several times when my code needed a simple addition or deletion, which is frustrating at the time, but not a big deal once it has been resolved.'","[b'I definitely agree with the method of repetition for this class.

Getting help from them is much more beneficial when the student has some sort of starting point, as opposed to going to lab knowing nothing.

Mason Atha,matha@purdue.edu,"b'The advice I would give to a new CS student is that you are going to need help, and to seek help as soon as possible. Seeking help through tutoring and reading the book have been my primary means of learning and growing in my knowledge of CS. Particularly with starting with Python as my CS first language, I have had to learn and continue to learn so many of the fundamentals and basics, and having someone be able to give me a good introduction and orientation to Python has helped me tremendously. I have found there to be some really essential rules that I had to have explained to me, but once I did I now feel much more comfortable programming. The most challenging part is so far has been that I may encounter a problem and have no idea what I am doing wrong.

Trying and experimenting hasn\xe2\x80\x99t always allowed me to find the correct answer quickly, but I have learned a lot from my failures and just from trials. I would advise new students to also always be referencing their past assignments as these have really helped me with the newer assignments.

I have not heard of programmiz but since I too will play around with Python then that is something I will check out!

Mayra Goreja,mgoreja@purdue.edu,"b""I have a few pieces of advice for new programmers. I think the aspects that have most helped me better understand this class have been:\n\n1. My TA's keeps telling\xc2\xa0me to just run my program. Even though I knew there would be problems, I was trying to fix them before discovering what those problems actually were. Having a program not run correctly shouldn't be taken as failure, but rather, you've learned how not to do it, and the feedback of the program helps you better debug the problem.\xc2\xa0\n\n2. I think I have learned the most about Python and the IDLE interface by just messing around with it. Setting aside time to just try to understand what everything does without the stress of finishing an assignment is ideal. That way, when the homework is due, you understand how the software itself runs, and that isn't an obstacle for when you are trying to complete the homework.\xc2\xa0\n\n3. In terms of preparing for assignments and the lab, I honestly believe the best source for help is the book. The simplified examples are there to teach the concepts required to finish the assignment, but I also understand that putting them together is the hard part. By starting the assignment the best you can with the knowledge that's presented in the book will give\xc2\xa0you a good start; afterwards, TA's are great in helping you understand the problem, especially if it's a conceptual problem, rather than something simple such as adding a comma, which can hopefully be found by simply running the program and staring at your own code for a bit. \xc2\xa0\n\n4. Surprisingly, there is definitely a sense of accomplishment and a bit of pride that comes when running a program correctly or completing an assignment for this class. I feel that this is because as students of other science majors, we are not use to the language of computer coding. It is this sense of accomplishment and honest interest that comes from creating something that eventually wills me to keep trying, and I hope new programmers feel the same way.\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n5. Try your best first, but then ask for help when you need it.\xc2\xa0\n""","[b""I completely agree in terms of reading the book; at first, I didn't think that learning aspects of a subject where you had to physically code something would be better learnt from a book, but our book does a great job explaining why each part of the coding should be written a certain way, and even cites which section the material was reviewed in at times. Reading defines the basics and helps those that are completely lost, as I was, and am sure still will be at times.\xc2\xa0""]"
Meera,mharidas@purdue.edu,"b""The thing that I've found the most challenging about CS 177 is probably learning the syntax of Python in general. I have coded in other languages before and Python, like other's, uses the same logic but has a different way of approaching the subject. For example, they have statements like elsif statements and all spacing in Python is important. In general the IDE is also a little hard to use and not that specific when giving error messages back. When an error is thrown, it tells you the line number but doesn't really give a detailed explanation of what the logical error is. Hopefully as I progress through the class, I'll be able to pick up the syntax more.\xc2\xa0""","[b""This is really useful to a new commer because coding can actually be really taxing on a person. Breaking things down and fully understanding the reasons why something is happening is the way to fully accept and come to terms with things. The first time I ever looked at code, I was actually really surprised as to how things were working. I completely agree with plugging things into the code because that's what makes things click and come together. But, breaking things down, into their individual components is what actually helps you in the end, because you aren't actually writing things you don't understand, you are putting together multiple pieces that you do know.\xc2\xa0""]"

Lecture and recitation definitely help you learn, but the book will give you a lot more information. Also I noticed my recitation is a few days after the homework is due, so I don't learn how to do the homework beforehand.

Be patient, sometimes the errors is a minor syntax issue. The amount of tries you take to get it right doesn't matter. All that does matter is that you got it correct and you know how and why.\xc2\xa0\n\nAnother tip would be to write it out first. All you ideas as to how it could work before you type it in the program's language. If you make mini checklist as to what needs to be accomplish it will help your nerves, you won't feel too overwhelmed and you'll complete the program correctly with understanding. after you finish writing try on paper what would happen if you plugged in small number like 2 & 4. if its right then move on to implementing correct syntax.\n\nIts good to get help, but doing it yourself, helps you learn permentantly.

Samantha,mill1000@purdue.edu,"b'There is a lot of advice I have for a new programmer or new student in CS 177. My first piece of advice would be to try to become familiar with the program Python before any assignments are due. When working to complete my first assignment, it took me an extremely long time mostly because I did not know the ins and outs of the Python program itself. Along with this, allowing LOTS of extra time to complete assignments will ensure you are able to finish the assignments on time. Oftentimes I have found that I am stuck on a problem but have waited until the night it is due to get help on it, which makes it complicated to get the assignment completed in time. Furthermore, if you are confused on a topic, don\'t be afraid to ask for help! There is no such things as a stupid question when it comes to learning to write programs when you have had no prior experience - you are literally learning a new language, so it is understandable for you to be confused or challenged! I would also suggest checking for problems in your code as you go along. If you have complete a long and tedious code and then get an ""error"", it will be much easier to fix your mistake if you know where your mistake is located. This will also save you time when working to complete your code. Lastly, patience is virtue when it comes to solving these types of puzzles! Don\'t be afraid to take a break from working on your program for a bit and come back to it - sometimes, you brain just needs a break.'","[b'Practice makes perfect, so I totally agree that working through examples in the book can be extremely beneficial! The book does a great job of breaking down exactly what each part of the code means, which can be very helpful when you have no idea where to start!

I also agree that these assignments take time - the biggest mistake I made the first two weeks was waiting until the last minute to finish my homework. Lastly, I think it is important, like you said, to make sure you understand what you are typing! Just because you were able to figure out the answer does not necessarily mean you totally understand it! Be sure you understand exactly why you are writing the code the way that you are - this will be beneficial when it is time to start studying for exams.']"

In my opinion, learning computer programming languages is similar to learning spoken languages. Just as you break a sentence into different parts to be conjugated, the code also has sections that need to be formatted differently. Also, each part of the code has a specific meaning and purpose.

Sarah Marshall,marsha55@purdue.edu,"b""This course has been challenging so far, but also very valuable. It requires a similar kind of learning to math subjects; while reading the textbook is important and necessary to learn the basics, without practice, it is impossible to retain the functions you are reading about. My best strategy for learning so far has been to open Python while I read each chapter, and try out the functions and programs as I read. This is especially beneficial in helping to learn the proper syntax necessary to run a program in Python. When just reading the textbook, it is easy to miss the number of parentheses, how far to indent, and when to include a colon. Working the book's practice codes and the practice problems at the end of each chapter allows me to see what works best for me, and to test what I learned from the chapter afterwards. It is also extremely helpful for the homework assignments in CodeLab because they utilize many of the same functions and structure that we read about it in the textbook.

It can be so tempting to just jump in and try to start writing, but planning ahead of time saves a lot of frustration in the end. I also think taking breaks is a really good idea. With prelab 2, I was getting really frustrated and kept making small changes that weren't making a big difference.

It has been equivalent to a kid trying to learn alphabets at elementary school but I believe that everything can be overcome with sufficient amount of hardwork and effort. So far, I have realized that CS is all about logic and mathematics. One needs to understand the basic idea of the problem and then the steps to solve the same.

Don't get bogged down by every single detail, as long as you understand the broader ideas that make up your program, that's what matters.

Programming is like playing a video game: there could be different approaches, but one must do it in a way that the computer recognizes.

Additionally, try to think about the logic of the code before jumping straight into the syntax and actual code. This can make a longer, more challenging code more manageable.'","[b'Abby, I think that is a really good point. Debugging is a much more crucial process than I initially realized-- I, and maybe many students taking this course, are used to trying to ""find the right answer"" and being penalized if we are not able to.

At first, I was very discouraged by this process, so it\'s nice to see that I am not the only one with this experience.

Once you have a solid base, you are then able to build upon that and let it flow into the rest of the semester.

As green hand, we should finish our code step by step. Take a simple example, variable x=a+1, and variable y=x+1. Of course we can directly type y=a+2 without a second thought, but if we are coding a more complex program, we are\xc2\xa0more likely to make mistakes. Coding step by step can prevent us for it.\n2. Writing comments for different parts of code is really helpful to clarify our thinking, because comments tell us what does each part of code do. It is also convenient for trouble shooting.\n3. We could write down code we have learned on a notebook, and label the function of them. So if we forget some code\xc2\xa0in future, we can check the notebook, just like checking dictionary.'","[b'The book does help a lot, since all assignments are based on the book.', b""I agree with returning to the trouble later and don't stuck at there, so that I can view the problem from a new aspect. I had a lot experiments of this when I was doing math."", b'I agree. The earlier we read the book, the more practice we can do.']"
Yue Yin,yin61@purdue.edu,"b""The advice I would give to new CS students is that, find some friends who are CS major, they might teach you more than 1 way to achieve same result in the prelabs or\xc2\xa0assignments. You can use those methods\xc2\xa0in different situations later, you might maximize your utility by comparing different methods. If you can't find any friends in CS major, you can just google the problems you can't understand, read more solutions, not only the\xc2\xa0top one. That can\xc2\xa0help you to diversify your codes, sometimes will save your time to thinking and typing.\xc2\xa0""","[b'I completely agree, good habits can help you organize you codes, solve the problems efficiently.\xc2\xa0']"
Yuheng Zhou,zhou612@purdue.edu,"b'For\xc2\xa0a beginner, especially who has never taken a CS class, it is really important to have an overall idea of how the coding system works. For example, when you open the IDLE to write codes, you should figure out that the \xe2\x80\x9cShell\xe2\x80\x9d is a good place to test a simple command but the actual right place to write codes of a program is to open a new file and write it there.\n\n \nOnce you are ready to do work with IDLE, the next step is to read and understand the assignment. The process of creating a program is not just about the language and coding, analyzing the problem and structuring it are the very first things you should do to start an assignment. Therefore, my second advice is to start the preparation part early so that you will have enough time to write codes, test and fix them.\n\n \nYou will soon find that there are multiple ways to work out one problem and don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid to make mistakes. By reading the assignment instruction carefully, you can always find hints of how to write and organize your codes. Combining with what you have read in the textbook, you just need to try and test. You will make progress while trying and practicing.\n\n \nFinally, don\xe2\x80\x99t freak out when you just can\xe2\x80\x99t get your codes work. Without sharing your codes or having someone written codes for you, you can always get help by asking questions on Piazza and going to help session. It might be hard at the beginning, but with the willingness to learn and practice, I believe you can do well on assignments.'","[b""I certainly agree with you about making good use of the examples in the textbook. Though formulating the program is the key to making it work, you cannot just write codes without knowing what results of those commands will be. If you don't understand the definition of a command, you hardly know whether the result is right or not. Getting familiar with simple commands and functions definitely helps you when you create programs later and your coding skill will be built up. By making mistakes and fixing them, you will learn and make progress fast. Additionally, working on problems on CodeLab also helps since you can get detailed feedback on your each wrong submission. You can also try to solve a problem in different ways and see which approaches work better and which do not even work. It is always true that you learn while practicing.""]"
Yuze lin,lin596@purdue.edu,"b'The biggest challenge in this course would be try to do the exercise prior to a lecture. Therefore, my advice to the new students for this course would be purchase the book as soon as possible, and look up the example on the book. Since you can submit your answer on the codelab several times for one particular question, it will be useful to look up the suggestion it gives you when your answer is wrong. \xc2\xa0Also, running your code on python directly would tell you where you make a mistake (such as syntax error). Getting a final correct answer after a number of failure will be most interesting and satisfying thing in this course.'","[b'Reading the book is really helpful, especially we need to submit the assignment before attending the lecture.\xc2\xa0']"
Zarek Wong,wongz@purdue.edu,"b""The advice that I would give to a new CS 177 student is to experiment a lot with your code. \xc2\xa0Try typing small snippets of code and see what happens when you run it. \xc2\xa0Then you can add more things into your code or change some things to see what happens. \xc2\xa0By doing this you can figure out what works and what doesn't and get a better grasp on how parts of the program work such as for loops. \xc2\xa0Since homework problems have unlimited submissions until the due date you can experiment as much as you want on those problems and codelab will tell you if you a right or not and state possible things that you might want to have in your program or are missing in your program. \xc2\xa0In addition I would also add that sometimes when you are stuck on a problem it is good to take a step back and think of another way that you can solve the problem. \xc2\xa0For example in this week's prelab I was at a loss on how to create a number grid and kept trying to do it one way, but after a few hours attempting to do it that way I realized that there was a much easier method that I could use and that made it much simpler so I was able to complete the assignment.""","[b""For homework I would add that it is also useful to learn how to read and understand why codelab will mark parts of your code as wrong. \xc2\xa0Initially it's a little confusing when you submit something to codelab thinking that it will work and it doesn't. \xc2\xa0Codelab will highlight the parts of the program that are wrong and the quicker you learn how to interpret why codelab is marking that part of the code as wrong the easier it will be to correct that part of the program. \xc2\xa0 A lot of my mistakes were easily resolved when I finally understood why codelab didn't accept my program.""]"
Zhaorui Zhang,zhan2287@purdue.edu,"b'As a non cs major student, I just learned and played with code for only three weeks, but I hope my advice will be a little bit helpful to other new students.\nWhat has challenged for me so far is to find the logic of problems and write the appropriate code. Analyzing what happened is the first thing you need to do when working out a problem. In most case, this is not an easy part, because you will have so many information and you need to arrange the steps, figure out cause and effect, so that you can solve the problem correctly. In addition, writing the proper code is also a difficult task. As a new beginner, he or she may often meet with the problem like ""syntax error"". Due to the reason that programming languages only obey some specific rules or orders when execute a command, beginners usually feel confused when testing code. For example, whether adding a space, putting quotations or not, are some complicated questions to beginner.\nTo better prepare for the study and assignments, I would recommend new beginners to start with a general view. Firstly, try to find out how programming languages work and why they are showed like that. In spite of the fact that each language is different, they often have some common things. Then, you can deep into more details like how to write or use codes. Moreover, normally you have two ways to get help: people and internet. Friends who have learned cs for a long time as maters are your good helpers. Internet is also a nice place which you can find useful information.'","[b'Very helpful and detailed suggestions! These advices give me much inspiration. Python reference library really does me a big favor when I met with problems. There are many useful information on the internet which can be very helpful. In addition, flow chart is a good way for both beginners and masters to solve problems.\xc2\xa0']"

ZHUOCHIWEN YU,yu387@purdue.edu,"b""For me, I used to take CS 158 one year ago and at that time, I totally knew nothing about CS. It was a hard time for me to get through since I did not have any knowledge and the course went fast that sometimes I couldn't recognize what the professor just talked. So I spent plenty of time on this course and started to find out that coding was very interesting.\nSo my advice for someone who barely know nothing is that if you are not confident or feeling stressed about coding, don't worry but the first thing you need to do is to read the textbooks. The textbook tells the basic knowledge and rules you need to know and follow like the elements of programs, the function of definite loops. If you don't understand some contents, just google that or go to the office hour to seek help. For me, I usually google that and to see if I can find any example or explanation about the question because I think it is a fast way to solve my confuse and maybe can learn new stuff. My major is mathematics so sometime I try to code something relates to what I am learning right now for fun. So if you have learned some knowledge about coding, why don't you have a try? Practice makes perfect. If you spend a lot of time and effort on it, something good will happen to you. And be careful to do that on a daily basis and do not try to read 1 or more chapters on one day or night. Put what you want to read and the relevant content you want to code on your notebook and make a plan to improve your coding consistently.""","[b'I totally agree. Textbook is really helpful since it gives us the basic rules and knowledge that we need to follow and to learn. Also learning from our past failures can help us figure out something we do not know. Like before, I used tab and space for coding but from my assignment, I found out that we cannot use them both. So do not afraid to make mistakes!']"
Zhuoer Wang,wang2829@purdue.edu,"b""Since I am not a CS major, and I didn't learn any programming knowledge before, I found it a little bit to start. I understand the assignment, and I know how to solve the problem, but sometimes I make wrong instructions to the computer. I found it hard to remember every single symbol to give a precise instruction to the computer. Thus for someone who is about to start a class, I highly suggest to do some little practices with python before going to the lecture. Also, office hour is very important.""","[b'Agree.

Zin Naing,znaing@purdue.edu,"b""Advice to another student about a class like CS 177:\n\nYou have to be patient in a class like this. Coding will not be the hardest part of the class, if you have a problem with your code, your text book or a simple google search will help you. Finding out the logic to the problem and deciphering what the problem is really asking is the key to completing the assignments successfully. Trial and error will be your best friend here but when your code does work, its one of the greatest feeling of accomplishment you'll get.\n""","[b""The CS help room does help as well as office hours. However, I do believe working out the code through the trial and error method will be a great benefit as well. Inserting print statements in after each calculate statement can show each step Python is taking and sometimes you can spot exactly where the error in your code is.\xc2\xa0\nWhen I am still stumped after I racked my brain on the code for a while and can't connect any more pieces, the office hours and help room do work wonders!""]"

Zoe Phillips,philliz@purdue.edu,"b'Advice I would have for someone new to python or any other programming language is when you are really stuck on problem and you turn to google for answers, don\'t just look up the problem you are having and try to find the answer to your exact problem on stackoverflow. I have found it more helpful to look up each individual function or piece of code that I don\'t understand. For example, when I was stuck on how to create a for loop that runs through a some values and adds them together I didn\'t look up ""how to code adding values on phython"" or whatever the specific question was. Instead I looked up ""for loops in python"" and tried to understand each individual argument so I could implement that into my code. In summary, I suggest trying to understand each function individually rather than the problem as a whole.\n\nAlso as a side note, don\'t be afraid to run your code before it\'s completely finished. Running your code between each step of writing it can help you understand how each step behaves.\xc2\xa0'",[]
