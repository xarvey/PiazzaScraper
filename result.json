The best way to learn a language is to start with the basics. Like math and science, learning a programming language is a structured process. It builds upon itself. Just like one needs to be able to add before they can multiply, a beginning programmer needs to become acquainted with the basics of the language.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 i) Start with the basics. Become familiar with variable assignments, variable types, and basic arithmetic operations. Be able to perform simple calculations and variable assignments. Knowing how these work are essential to continuing on in learning. These are like the skeleton of your programming abilities.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ii) Next work on understanding built in operators and functions. Know how to convert variables from one type to another. Know how to take a user input and assign it to a variable. Know how to use for and while loops. These will give you versatility in what you can do with your program. This will be the nervous and muscular systems. It will get data inputted, transferred, stored, and outputted.</p>\n<p>These are the basics that will be important to mastering any language.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>II) Practice makes Permanent! If I have heard it once, I have heard it a million times, Practice makes Permanent! Cheesy but True.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 i) Habits begin forming as soon as you start to write your very first script. Practice good coding standards. Use comments frequently. If your code changes, change the comment to reflect what changes. The sharp sign / pound sign &#39;#&#39; is the comment symbol for python.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ii) Keep old code, scripts, assignments, and such. They are great resources to help you when you forget how something works, and can provide templates to solve new problems.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 iii) Play around on IDLE. Learn how things work, and what will throw an error. This hands on experience will help you get familiar with the nuances of programming in python.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>III) Make It Fun / Make It Useful</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 i) Consider taking what you are learning and apply it to other areas of study. Make a program that can convert units for a physics class, or a program that will do vector addition for a math class. Use it in presentations and projects. There are many applications of programming that can be used to help your life. Some non CS classes you will take will have a programming component. PHYS 172 and 272 use VPython, a subset of python. ENGR 141 and 142 use Python as well. Knowing python will help tremendously with these activities.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ii) Create a program just for fun. Play around with printing strings. Make an interactive game with a user inputs. Try to solve problems in new ways. Create a universal formula sheet/solver for basic geometric shapes. Create designs using print statements.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 iii) Consider an app for your phone that is an editor, IDLE, or python instructor. These will allow you to be able to practice programming when you only have a minute or two.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>IV) Get help if you need it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 i) Your textbook, your Teachers, your TAs are all great resources. If you have questions/issues ask.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ii) Work on learning why the program works instead of just getting an answer. This will make it easier to reuse. </p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 iii) I personally find the python reference library helpful for finding and using both modules and built in operations and functions.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 iv) Although Stack Exchange and other online help sites may give you an answer, just be cautious you understand why you are doing what they said. There are times they will give an answer that is above your skill level, or introduce concepts that have not been taught in class. If you use such sites, make sure you are learning the code concepts, and not just looking for an answer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p># Closing Comments:</p>\n<p># Comments are important. Use them often and with purpose</p>\n<p></p>\n<p># The only way to learn to write good code is to have experience. The only way to get experience is to write bad code.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p># If you are having trouble working through a solution, try diagramming a flow chart. For people who did not pass through ENGR 141 or who are not familiar, a flowchart is a diagram that represents an algorithm or workflow. It involves writing down the ideas of your program with symbols that represent different types of operations.</p>\n<p>The visual path of information that you want your program to follow can be very helpful.

I am used to the professor telling me what we need to know, and then I would go home and learn it. Also, memorizing comes in handy when you need to learn the bodies anatomy or biochemical pathways. You could spend hours memorizing and writing theses until you have it down perfectly - and even if you might not have fully understood WHAT you were learning - you could still do fine on the exam when it asked you to recall.

Analyzing what happened is the first thing you need to do when working out a problem. In most case, this is not an easy part, because you will have so many information and you need to arrange the steps, figure out cause and effect, so that you can solve the problem correctly. In addition, writing the proper code is also a difficult task. As a new beginner, he or she may often meet with the problem like &#34;syntax error&#34;. Due to the reason that programming languages only obey some specific rules or orders when execute a command, beginners usually feel confused when testing code. For example, whether adding a space, putting quotations or not, are some complicated questions to beginner.</p>\n<p><br />To better prepare for the study and assignments, I would recommend new beginners to start with a general view. Firstly, try to find out how programming languages work and why they are showed like that. In spite of the fact that each language is different, they often have some common things. Then, you can deep into more details like how to write or use codes. Moreover, normally you have two ways to get help: people and internet. Friends who have learned cs for a long time as maters are your good helpers.

I am NOT saying that they would fail the class, but there are going to be a lot of times that you will not get a code correct or get your program to work. It is extremely frustrating when you cannot work out a problem, but do not let that stop you. It is exactly like learning anything else that is new\u2026 it takes practice!

It is amazing how helpful the professor and TAs are. They understand that this course is very different from our others.</p>\n<p>3.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Many students in this class have mentioned that watching online videos can be beneficial and I strongly agree. I am a visual learner. With that being said, I do not learn well from reading the book. I have to actually watch/see how things can be done. Take advantage of online help. It is just another way to try and understand Python better.</p>\n<p>4.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Open up your mind. There are many ways to do things in this class. Python allows you to make one program by taking different approaches. So, it is perfectly fine to create a program differently than your friends!

Even though I knew there would be problems, I was trying to fix them before discovering what those problems actually were. Having a program not run correctly shouldn&#39;t be taken as failure, but rather, you&#39;ve learned how not to do it, and the feedback of the program helps you better debug the problem.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2. I think I have learned the most about Python and the IDLE interface by just messing around with it. Setting aside time to just try to understand what everything does without the stress of finishing an assignment is ideal. That way, when the homework is due, you understand how the software itself runs, and that isn&#39;t an obstacle for when you are trying to complete the homework.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3. In terms of preparing for assignments and the lab, I honestly believe the best source for help is the book. The simplified examples are there to teach the concepts required to finish the assignment, but I also understand that putting them together is the hard part. By starting the assignment the best you can with the knowledge that&#39;s presented in the book will give\u00a0you a good start; afterwards, TA&#39;s are great in helping you understand the problem, especially if it&#39;s a conceptual problem, rather than something simple such as adding a comma, which can hopefully be found by simply running the program and staring at your own code for a bit. \u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4. Surprisingly, there is definitely a sense of accomplishment and a bit of pride that comes when running a program correctly or completing an assignment for this class. I feel that this is because as students of other science majors, we are not use to the language of computer coding.

First of all I think one of the most helpful methods to create working code is by planning it out before you start. You can do this by putting comments to organize and plan out each part of the code. This is useful because it allows you to go back and see what the function of each line of code. It also allows you to find problems within your code faster and more efficiently. The odds are you are naturally going to make many mistakes when you first start so this becomes very useful. It also ensures that you do not forget any function that the code is suppose to have which comes in handy when you are dealing with projects that require several functions. Lastly, it is very important that you are very comfortable with the information you are learning while you are learning it before you move on to a new topic. Let me explain, learning to code is like building a house. If you don&#39;t have the fundamentals down or in this comparison, the foundation of the house built well, you will struggle with future topics that you will learn and your &#34;house&#34; will fall down. You need a strong foundation to build off up in order to learn and understand the harder topics you will learn in the future.

The textbook tells the basic knowledge and rules you need to know and follow like the elements of programs, the function of definite loops. If you don&#39;t understand some contents, just google that or go to the office hour to seek help. For me, I usually google that and to see if I can find any example or explanation about the question because I think it is a fast way to solve my confuse and maybe can learn new stuff. My major is mathematics so sometime I try to code something relates to what I am learning right now for fun. So if you have learned some knowledge about coding, why don&#39;t you have a try? Practice makes perfect. If you spend a lot of time and effort on it, something good will happen to you. And be careful to do that on a daily basis and do not try to read 1 or more chapters on one day or night.

So far in the past 4 weeks I have learned a lot and I find that this course could be useful for anyone with zero to little programming experience. And, now that I am starting to get used to the course routine I would say that the pre-labs have been the most challenging part for me. I believe what makes them challenging is the fact that we have to put our knowledge to the test. The pre-labs are based on lecture information and textbook readings that we have gone over. Yet I feel as though the pre-lab assignments\u00a0are made slightly more difficult than the material covered\u00a0in class in\u00a0order to help us develop the essential skills\u00a0for Python\u00a0understanding. They are challenging but they&#39;re also very interesting. Now\u00a0I can see why people assimilate programming to a language. For someone interested in the course I would suggest reading the textbook thoroughly. It contains a lot of useful information that can significantly help during homework/pre-lab assignments. Another tip would be reviewing material. Go over notes, the textbook, and pre-labs/labs. Although it may seem unnecessary it is helpful. Reviewing material is like practicing; the more you do it, the easier it will get. I like to browse around at other Python activities online which may be useful when it comes to learning new skills, (however this is just an option). Overall, just putting in the effort to actually learn a programming language will lead to mastering the skills. Sometimes you may need to go out of your way to learn a certain task (such as going over homework 1) but if it will help in the long run than don&#39;t see it as something troublesome; think of it as practice.</p>"}, {"folders": [], "updated": "2017-02-01T02:51:12Z", "no_upvotes": 0, "uid": "iy855t6jqui562", "created": "2017-02-01T02:51:12Z", "type": "followup", "no_answer": 1, "id": "iymcwbojdb35bq", "anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 1/29 - 2/4", "config": {}, "bucket_order": 7, "data": null, "children": [], "subject": "<p>When I first started this course I had absolutely no experience in coding.

Running your code between each step of writing it can help you understand how each step behaves.\u00a0</p>"}, {"folders": [], "updated": "2017-02-01T04:55:08Z", "no_upvotes": 0, "uid": "iy855uz4ay15ei", "created": "2017-02-01T04:55:08Z", "type": "followup", "no_answer": 1, "id": "iymhbp85nrp42z", "anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 1/29 - 2/4", "config": {}, "bucket_order": 7, "data": null, "children": [], "subject": "<p>I have no prior experience with programming personally but several of my friends and family are extremely into all things computers and so I have heard the term &#34;coding language&#34; thrown around a lot. Even in class the term is used. But I find it helpful to actually take a moment and really think about what a coding language means. Regardless of what language a person speaks the goal is the same- to tell someone else to do something or about something. A coding language is no different except for the fact that you are trying to &#34;talk&#34; to a computer instead of a person. When you tell someone to do something you give the instructions in order: you don&#39;t jump around. So when trying to give the computer instructions; pause and ask &#34;if I was trying to tell this to someone else, does this order make sense?&#34;. This way of thinking is helpful to me at least.</p>"}, {"folders": [], "updated": "2017-02-01T04:58:50Z", "no_upvotes": 0, "uid": "ib0viyx8gul", "created": "2017-02-01T04:58:50Z", "type": "followup", "no_answer": 1, "id": "iymhggasm8xvl", "anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 1/29 - 2/4", "config": {}, "bucket_order": 7, "data": null, "children": [], "subject": "<p>Advice for new CS 177 students</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*Please read carefully the following:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1) Make sure you have enough hair on top of your head to grasp.
