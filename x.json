Instead of reading code to understand it, I have found extra practice examples are especially valuable. There are many apps which can let you practice Python on your phone.

I usually like to start and finish assignments in one sitting and be able to &#34;check off&#34; another item on my list. But that isn&#39;t always possible with this class and the assignments as they seem to be more problem solving based and there is usually trouble shooting involved. It has been helpful for me to practice patience and sometimes step away from the assignment and come back later and try again. I think that starting as early in the week as possible is important so that you have the freedom to be patient, go slow, and try again (as your third point says.. making mistakes usually leads to better learning!)</p>'

In my opinion, learning computer programming languages is similar to learning spoken languages. Just as you break a sentence into different parts to be conjugated, the code also has sections that need to be formatted differently. Also, each part of the code has a specific meaning and purpose. Even a tab is there for a reason so it helps to connect these formatting changes with their function in solving the problem at hand.</p>'

I also agree that these assignments take time - the biggest mistake I made the first two weeks was waiting until the last minute to finish my homework. Lastly, I think it is important, like you said, to make sure you understand what you are typing!

To be 100% honest, there&#39;s been many times when I have no idea what I am doing! The professor and TAs were not available during a lot of those times and so I tried looking to the internet for help. Being able to see how others faced programming problems opened up my eyes to different approaches that I could take as well. It is just another way of trying to understand Python outside of class. I am not saying that the book is a bad source, because it has helped me with many assignment problems. It is just a bit harder for me to comprehend. For some people it takes many different explanations of a topic for them to be able to understand it. Youtube videos can serve as some of those extra explanations.\xa0</p>'

CS 177 is different than most courses in such a way that the answer is not always flat out given to you through a set method or use of formulas. You must read the book to understand concepts and then use his own knowledge and thinking style to actually produce the code. Also, slowing down and actually thinking about what you are telling a program to do is essential. Often times, it is easy to get frustrated and work quickly with Python, but slowing down and taking a step back is quite effective in succeeding in this course. Good post!</p>'

First of all, the reason a programming class has numerous TA&#39;s and available resources is that coding is hard and time taking, it is totally fine to have questions and to struggle for hours. TA&#39;s and professor are always there to guide and help us, all we need to do is ask. It is an interactive and quick way of learning, and there is nothing to be shame of, because everyone goes through this process. Furthermore, a textbook contains its author&#39;s (usually expert) lifelong wisdom and refined\xa0tips. Reading it allows\xa0us\xa0to stand on shoulders of giants so that we could see further. More importantly, practicing as many the problems in the textbook as possible is always going to better prepare us for our lectures, labs, and homework.</p>'

Understanding the logic is something i have been trying to force myself to do in this class so as to make it easier for me to succeed in assignments and in exams with the hope that i will be able to successfully program at the end of this class. I also agree with the help, there is a lot of help in this class and load of office hours I would definitely advice taking advantage of those.</p>'
